# naural

A simple binaural beat generator.

# Usage

Specify a base frequency that will be played in the left audio channel, then specify a resultant difference frequency.
Press play to start the audio. Background play on mobile is supported. Linux support requires MPV to be installed. Web
support lacks gapless playback, so the audio will be inconsistent/broken.

# Privacy policy

No data from the device is sent off of the device whatsoever.
